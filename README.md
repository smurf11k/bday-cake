[**Live Site**](https://smurf11k.github.io/bday-cake/)

This is a personalized birthday greeting website featuring an animated birthday cake — a fun and creative way to say *Happy Birthday!* 🎉

### About

The website was made as a surprise birthday gift for a friend. It features a celebratory cake animation and warm birthday vibes. It’s a small, interactive way to make someone smile on their special day.

### Based On

This project is an updated and personalized version of the original [**"Birthday Cake with CSS Animation"** by Jens Jørgen Jørgensen](https://codepen.io/JensJ/pen/MzZrbw) on CodePen.

Modifications and additions include:

* Customized message and layout
* Responsive design improvements
* Updated visuals and styling tweaks
* Added interactivity (the candles can be blown)

### Purpose

Made as a digital birthday card — easy to share, fun to view, and way cooler than a plain message. 🎁
